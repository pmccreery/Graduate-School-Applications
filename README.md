# Graduate School Applications
This repository has the goal to give you a complete look at the graduate school application, from the beginning of the search to accepting your future offer (I'm confident you can get there, just stick to it)! 

# Structure of Files
To start, you'll find 3 folders -- Applications, Decision Letters, and General Documents. Applications contains all of my statements (diversity, personal, research, etc.) that I wrote for applications. The Decision Letters folder contains the acceptance letters I received (rejection letters aren't that interesting, and I don't want to dig rejection back up.) These give you an idea of the pay I was offered, the benefits, how to accept, what to expect, and general information about what they expect from you as a student/researcher. The General Documents folder contains my CV, resume, transcripts, etc. that schools might ask for. This gives you an idea about what my CV looked like (it's a template, feel free to use it if you're familiar with TeX). Below these folders, you'll find "Patrick McCreery - Graduate Schools.xlsx" -- this contains the spreadsheet I used to personally keep track of logistics as well as give to letter writers for more context about what they're writing for.

# Numbers and Context
Now, the numbers are tricky; Never compare yourself to others, but to give you a complete picture of my application, it's important to mention what I was working with when applying. A full picture is on my CV.

- Cumulative GPA: 3.99, Astronomy/Physics GPA: 4.0
- GRE: Did not take!
- Research projects:
  - 1 REU at Montana State University
  - 1 true research project (an honors thesis), 2 or 3 informal projects that were serious, but attached to a class.
- Publications: 0
- Presentations: (1 at AGU via my REU)
- Awards:
  - Charles A. Barth: LASP award to undergraduate researchers
  - Theodore Snow: APS Department award
- Courses:
  - 2 semesters of classical mechanics, electrodynamics, quantum mechanics
  - 1 semester of thermodynamics/statistical mechanics
  - Mathematics up to PDEs (graduate level) + minor in probability and statistics
  - Planetary science courses (graduate level), astrophysics, research methods, and solar physics
- Leadership + Volunteer
  - CU STARs (astronomy related outreach)
  - Dorm Resident Advisor

Hopefully this provides a reasonable amount of context as to where I stood when applying, but, again, DO NOT compare yourself to anyone. Your application is unique :)

# Where to start
Now that you understand your numbers and the context of your application, how do you go from nothing to accepting an admission letter? 

Step -1 - Get your documents together. Transcipts (unofficial, of course), CV, resume, writing sample, should all be immediately available for your own good. Get organized with respect to this.

Step 0 - Get recommendation letters from reliable people. I usually attempted to get one faculty who knew my research, one who knew my academics, and one faculty for research/character (schools want to make sure you'll fit in their culture as well as academics). Get them NOW. Stop reading and don't come back until you have 3 people willing to write letters. You need quality, genuine letters to have a chance.

The first thing you should think about is, broadly, what do you want to do? For me, I wanted to do exoplanet or solar research. This immediately narrowed down my options and provided a framework to look at schools that would work for me. CU Boulder, my home school, was the most obvious choice -- exoplanets and solar physics are focuses there and was a clear contender for an application. For the others, it's guess and check. Harvard? MIT? UC system? Johns Hopkins? East coast? Just guess some schools and see if they have what you want. Larger schools will likely have what you want. You'll be biased to think about schools that are probably reaches for even the best of schools, so try to look at schools that aren't MIT or Harvard. Obviously apply to them, but you can't only apply to Columbia-esque schools. New Mexico State, Louisiana, Montana State are all schools I considered to be a correct fit, but not as difficult as Harvard. Check the US News & World Report. They have lists of schools, and most importantly, talk to your faculty. Ask where they suggest you look and make sure you get a sold ~20 schools on a potential list.

So now that you have ~20 schools in the tiers of somewhat likely, stretch, and reach, you have to get organized.

# Organization
The organization could very well be the most difficult part of this process. I applied to 12 different schools, narrowed down from probably 20. Some decisions I made based on my gut, but others you can rule out due to GRE requirements, school location, lack of interest in program, or just vibes alone.

Once you have your schools narrowed down (12 should be the absolute maximum), create a folder (local or Drive or whatever you use)! I opened every application, noted the due dates and my interest in the school in a spread sheet, then copy and pasted each prompt for statements in a text document. This provides your whole framework! At this point, you're already mostly done, it's just writing from this point onwards -- congrats! You should have a spreadsheet that looks similar to mine where you have dates for both letter and application due dates (could be the same or different), what you need to do for each, the specific interests in each school, and who you expect to write a letter for each school (don't do more than 3 letters per school). This is for you AND your letter writers, so make it pretty!
