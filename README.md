# Graduate School Applications
This repository has the goal to give you a complete look at the graduate school application, from the beginning of the search to accepting your future offer (I'm confident you can get there, just stick to it)! 

# Structure of Files
To start, you'll find 3 folders -- Applications, Decision Letters, and General Documents. Applications contains all of my statements (diversity, personal, research, etc.) that I wrote for applications. The Decision Letters folder contains the acceptance letters I received (rejection letters aren't that interesting, and I don't want to dig rejection back up.) These give you an idea of the pay I was offered, the benefits, how to accept, what to expect, and general information about what they expect from you as a student/researcher. The General Documents folder contains my CV, resume, transcripts, etc. that schools might ask for. This gives you an idea about what my CV looked like (it's a template, feel free to use it if you're familiar with TeX). Below these folders, you'll find "Patrick McCreery - Graduate Schools.xlsx" -- this contains the spreadsheet I used to personally keep track of logistics as well as give to letter writers for more context about what they're writing for.

# Numbers and Context
Now, the numbers are tricky; Never compare yourself to others, but to give you a complete picture of my application, it's important to mention what I was working with when applying. A full picture is on my CV.

- Cumulative GPA: 3.99, Astronomy/Physics GPA: 4.0
- GRE: Did not take!
- Research projects:
  - 1 REU at Montana State University
  - 1 true research project (an honors thesis), 2 or 3 informal projects that were serious, but attached to a class.
- Publications: 0
- Presentations: (1 at AGU via my REU)
- Awards:
  - Charles A. Barth: LASP award to undergraduate researchers
  - Theodore Snow: APS Department award
- Courses:
  - 2 semesters of classical mechanics, electrodynamics, quantum mechanics
  - 1 semester of thermodynamics/statistical mechanics
  - Mathematics up to PDEs (graduate level) + minor in probability and statistics
  - Planetary science courses (graduate level), astrophysics, research methods, and solar physics
- Leadership + Volunteer
  - CU STARs (astronomy related outreach)
  - Dorm Resident Advisor

Hopefully this provides a reasonable amount of context as to where I stood when applying, but, again, DO NOT compare yourself to anyone. Your application is unique :)

# Where to start
Now that you understand your numbers and the context of your application, how do you go from nothing to accepting an admission letter? 

Step -1 - Get your documents together. Transcipts (unofficial, of course), CV, resume, writing sample, should all be immediately available for your own good. Get organized with respect to this.

Step 0 - Get recommendation letters from reliable people. I usually attempted to get one faculty who knew my research, one who knew my academics, and one faculty for research/character (schools want to make sure you'll fit in their culture as well as academics). Get them NOW. Stop reading and don't come back until you have 3 people willing to write letters. You need quality, genuine letters to have a chance.

The first thing you should think about is, broadly, what do you want to do? For me, I wanted to do exoplanet or solar research. This immediately narrowed down my options and provided a framework to look at schools that would work for me. CU Boulder, my home school, was the most obvious choice -- exoplanets and solar physics are focuses there and was a clear contender for an application. For the others, it's guess and check. Harvard? MIT? UC system? Johns Hopkins? East coast? Just guess some schools and see if they have what you want. Larger schools will likely have what you want. You'll be biased to think about schools that are probably reaches for even the best of schools, so try to look at schools that aren't MIT or Harvard. Obviously apply to them, but you can't only apply to Columbia-esque schools. New Mexico State, Louisiana, Montana State are all schools I considered to be a correct fit, but not as difficult as Harvard. Check the US News & World Report. They have lists of schools, and most importantly, talk to your faculty. Ask where they suggest you look and make sure you get a sold ~20 schools on a potential list.

So now that you have ~20 schools in the tiers of somewhat likely, stretch, and reach, you have to get organized. With these schools, look out for fee waivers. 10 schools can easily cost $1000 in application fees, but I had many schools waived by expressing my situation to the coordinators. I don't have FAFSA or other paperwork that proves my financial situation, but few schools require that level of proof. If you need the assistance, reach out -- they'll help. 

# Organization
The organization could very well be the most difficult part of this process. I applied to 12 different schools, narrowed down from probably 20. Some decisions I made based on my gut, but others you can rule out due to GRE requirements, school location, lack of interest in program, or just vibes alone.

Once you have your schools narrowed down (12 should be the absolute maximum), create a folder (local or Drive or whatever you use)! I opened every application, noted the due dates and my interest in the school in a spread sheet, then copy and pasted each prompt for statements in a text document. This provides your whole framework! At this point, you're already mostly done, it's just writing from this point onwards -- congrats! You should have a spreadsheet that looks similar to mine where you have dates for both letter and application due dates (could be the same or different), what you need to do for each, the specific interests in each school, and who you expect to write a letter for each school (don't do more than 3 letters per school). This is for you AND your letter writers, so make it pretty!


# Applications and Statements
Open them ASAP! You need to see all of the long answer prompts that will take time to complete. Don't complete them immediately, but copy-paste the prompts into a place where you can draft a response. 

Take your time. The statements are, by far, the most critical part of your application -- and that's good -- it's the area you have the most control over. Do not lie, but give yourself some credit. If you participated in outreach, include it (as appropriate). Class projects can be great additions if they're substantial projects. Make it clear what you've done, but don't just summarize. A beneficial concept that I've learned to apply -- your skill toolbox. Projects add to your toolbox, and a graduate program is the ultimate tool collecting experience. Programs want to understand the tools you have and the potential you have to add to this toolbox. If they wanted teachers or researchers, they'd hire them. They want to develop your toolbox to continue their brand and to make a mark on the community. If you can show that you have the tools and the drive to add to this toolbox, you have a great chance of being accepted into that given program. It's not about the number of tools to get the job done -- it's the right tools. 

Your statements are there to help you express what is in your toolbox (not how you acquired the tools), and why you're a good fit for a given program. What you've done is irrelevant, it's a matter of proving what you can do. An REU proves to a school you can put in the work and that you have experience with research. It's not what happened that matters, it's what you've learned. Express what about the specific program you're applying to can do for your professional career. What are your goals (generally, don't overthink it) and how can this program help reach your goals? Drop faculty names, programs, outreach organizations, etc. to show you know what the program has to offer and how these would help you develop into a productive scientist. What are your interests in research? What does the program have for you? They want to help you and develop your skills, show them that you'd get a lot out of their program.

If there were 10 students asking you for help on Calculus homework, for example, you'd want to choose the student who seems most enthusiastic and most willing to put in the work to learn -- not necessarily the smartest and most experienced. 

Your statements should be thoughtful -- don't fully copy-paste essays between schools, as they end up stale. Put in the effort. It's worth it. If you aren't proud of your work, programs will know. If you haven't put the time into your application, they won't put the time into reading it. Be proud of your work.

My statements follow a general flow, so it should be realatively easy to pick up on trends. I did change up the style for different schools -- variety is the spice of life! I wasn't sure what was the best method, so I just tried a lot of things. 

# Some truths
The application process is random. Qualifications can get you so far, but among the 20% who are probably qualified enough to enter a given program, they need to reduce that pool. This means random choice comes into play. Who read your essay? Do they like old-school essays or do they like color? Do they appreciate your background as a solar physics student? Maybe not if they are in particle physics. The best application is subjective and depends on who reads it, the time of day, phase of the moon, their breakfast, whatever. Don't take any of this personal. It's random. Do your best to get the best odds, but still remember it's up to chance. Maximize your chances. 

# Results
Typically, a 1/10 success rate is decent overall. Better applications will perform better, but across the board, 1/10 is decent. That's why I applied to 12, I expected to get into one, but ended up having to choose from four schools!

- Berkeley Astronomy: Rejected
- CU Boulder: Rejected (barely missed, according to rejection letter)
- Johns Hopkins: Accepted, accepted admission
- Louisiana State University: Accepted, declined admission
- MIT EAPS: Rejected
- New Mexico State: Rejected
- Penn State: Rejected
- UC Santa Cruz: Rejected
- University of Arizona: Rejected
- University of Hawai'i: Rejected
- Montana State University: Accepted, declined amission
- University of Minnesota: Accepted, declined admission

Hopefully these results help you understand which statements were maybe (?) better. Again, it's random. Why would Johns Hopkins accept me, but the other universities didn't? No idea. If you figure out why other schools weren't interested, reach out! My applications aren't perfect, but they're a good start and have proven success (at least decent enough success).

# Final Thoughts
You got this! I have faith that you can get admitted into at least one of your programs -- if not more. Patience is key. I received rejections before acceptances. If you hear back soon, you got a first round rejection... Then second round rejections... then at the end you learn about acceptances. The longer it takes, the better your chances (probably). 

If you need any help, feel free to reach out to Zoom, call, email, send carrier pigeons, whatever. I'll read statements, help with CVs, suggest schools, whatever you need!

Good luck,
